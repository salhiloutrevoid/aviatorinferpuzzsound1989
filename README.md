### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

Playing the Aviator game is simple, but mastering it requires practice.
Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

    can choose the amount you wish to wager before the round begins.
2.  **Watch the Plane**: Once the round starts, the plane takes off. The
    multiplier begins to increase as the plane flies.
